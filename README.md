# Project-Simpson-character-recognition
In this project OpenCV along with various other open libraries of machine learning  are used for recognising the character of popular cartoon Simpsons


Project Title: Simpsons Character Recognition

->Description:

•The Simpsons Character Recognition project aims to build a machine learning model capable of recognizing characters from the popular TV show "The Simpsons" using image data. The project utilizes a dataset consisting of images of various Simpsons characters, organized into separate folders for each character. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify the character depicted in a given image.


->Project Structure:

•••Data Collection and Preprocessing:
•The training data consists of images of Simpsons characters organized into separate directories for each character. Data preprocessing involves resizing images to a uniform size, converting them to grayscale, and normalizing pixel values. Model Development:

•The model is built using the Keras deep learning library. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is employed for feature extraction and classification. The model is trained using the preprocessed image data, with appropriate optimization techniques such as data augmentation and learning rate scheduling. Testing and Evaluation:

•The trained model is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance in character recognition. Performance metrics such as accuracy and loss are calculated to measure the model's effectiveness. Deployment:

•Once trained and evaluated, the model can be deployed to recognize Simpsons characters in new images. The model's predictions can be visualized and used for various applications, such as character identification in videos or social media posts. Key Technologies Used:

•Python OpenCV (cv2) NumPy Matplotlib Keras caer (Computer Vision library) canaro (Deep Learning library for Computer Vision) Project Outcome: The Simpsons Character Recognition project provides a practical demonstration of image classification using deep learning techniques. By accurately identifying Simpsons characters, the model showcases the potential of machine learning in recognizing and classifying objects within images, with applications ranging from entertainment to image processing and automation.
